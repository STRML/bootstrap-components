            </li>
            <li>We don't have the key - it is generated in your browser. <b>We cannot read your files.</b>
            </li>
            <li>All communications are verified &amp; encrypted with SSL.
            </li>
            <li>We use very long, randomly generated URLs so your data cannot be found.
            </li>
            <li>Auto-generated strong cipher passwords make brute-forcing infeasible.
            </li>
            <li>Your data is automatically and securely deleted after use.
            </li>

            <li>You select how many times the file can be accessed.
            </li>
            <li>Your browser uploads the file. Before it is sent to us, it is encrypted by your browser.
            </li>
            <li>We give you a link to share the file. This link is unique and cannot be guessed.
            </li>
            <li>The recipient requests the file and decrypts it in his/her browser.
            </li>
            <li>We are never sent the cipher key - we cannot decrypt your data.
            </li>
            <li>No logs are kept.
